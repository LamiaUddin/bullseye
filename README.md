# bullseye
This is a simple iOS app that I created by following a Ray Wenderlich tutorial on creating a SwiftUI app. The app was built using Swift and Swift UI.
The objective of the game is to move the slider to as close to the given value as you can, points are generated based on how close you are to the actual value.
